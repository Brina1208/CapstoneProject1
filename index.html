    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
    <p>I'm a Hungarian 25 year old, currently working for Wise. I've got a degree in Biology, then went on to work for Starbucks. That was a 3.5 year long journey. Sadly, it ended painfully, and I'm still suffering from the consequences (panic attacks and stuff like that). It was way too stressful and I was expected to do the impossible every single day. I did, but it was never enough, they always wanted more. After I left, all the others left the place too. I guess it wasn't a me problem.</p>
    <p>Since I've been working for Wise (started on the 21st of March), my life has been much more balanced. No more waking up early and working till late. Im still going to bed pretty late, but at least it's my choice. I mean not really a concious choice, but I love torturing myself I guess.I've got started on a Business Informatics degree while I was still at Starbucks, but I'm not sure if I want to go ahead with it now. I can just learn everything in my own pace from the internet, right?</p>
